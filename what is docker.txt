What is docker

- docker is a platform for building, running and shipping application

Some application run on our development machine, but doesn't run on our 
friend's or it can be customer.

Reasons
 - One or more files missing
 - software version mismatch
 - different configuration settings - like env variables

 then here comes the docker

container - An Isolated env for running an application
Virtual machine - an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware)

Hypervisors - exp - VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-v (windows only)

containers allows us to
allow running multiple apps in isolation
are lightweight
use os of the host
start quickly
need less hardware Resources

docker image contains these thing
 - a cut down os
 - a runtime env (eg, node)
 - apllication files
 - third party libraries
